The aim of this blog is to keep recipes, know-hows and notes related to my hobby so I can come back here and remind myself what I did and how.  

I'm not going to teach anyone, I'm not going to say that my solution is absolutely right and best. But supporting the open software idea, I'm keeping the records open.  If it inspires you - good! If you would like to point me out to any other way how to do what I did - it's wonderful! [Twitter](https://twitter.com/valnik) or [say hello](/contact/) could be a communication channel.
